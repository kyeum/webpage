Design and Control of Humanoid Ski Robot Platform(인간형 스키로봇 플랫폼의 설계 및 제어)

Robot : Rudolph -Height : 160cm(63inch)

Weight : 60kg(132lb) -15 Degree of Freedom

Rule : Humanoid robot should autonomously detect the flags and go through it.

The competition floor : 20mX80m(65ftX262ft)

 This project describes a humanoid ski robot to participate in Ski Robot Challenge held by Korea Institute for Robot Industry Advancement invoking 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic. Based on ski thesis, Our team(R&D) designed and controlled the high-weight humanoid robot,which has 160cm height, 60kg weight, to skiing like human. The team consists of 4 members : Hyung Won Yoon, Woo Jae Lee, Deok Jin Lee ,and myself. Ski robot do autonomous control on the slope which is as same as real ski contest using several sensor system and path planning control. With the difference in two legs, Ski Robot can turn and with ZMP control algorithm using pendulum and Gyroscope, ski robot could be stable while turning. Path planning, detecting flags with lidar and vision, checking robot location with GPS, Robot can control himself. In this regard, we made autonomous robot detecting flags and modifying the path.
